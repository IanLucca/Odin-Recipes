    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Cans Black Eyed Peas</li>
        <li>1 Onion, Chopped</li>
        <li>1 Clove Garlic, Chopped</li>
        <li>2 TBSP Flour</li>
        <li>1 Small Chili Pepper</li>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Thoroughly drain the black-eyed peas and place them in the food processor. Add the onion and garlic to the peas.</li>
        <li>Remove the seeds and white parts from the inside of the chili pepper and add to the processor.</li>
        <li>Purée until smooth, adding a tablespoon or two of water if needed.</li>
        <li>Transfer to a bowl. Add flour by the tablespoon, until the mixture is stiff enough to hold a shape. Beat the batter for a few minutes with a wooden spoon, until it is light and fluffy. Divide into 15 pieces, and shape into balls or ovals with the palms of your hand.</li>
        <li>Heat 2 inches palm oil or vegetable oil in a pot over medium-high heat. Fry several fritters at a time until browned on all sides. Drain fritters on a plate lined with paper towels. Slice the fritters open down the center and spoon with Vatapa, Brazilian Shrimp Stew. Serve with hot sauce.</li>
